<h2 id="report">Report</h2>
<h2 id="the-projects-overview">The Project’s overview</h2>
<p>This project involved creating and deploying a professional profile
website on GitHub Pages as part of the “Web Application Programming and
Hacking” course. The website showcases my education, experiences,
technical skills, and cybersecurity interests. Key features include the
use of Bootstrap, JavaScript-based interactions, public API
integrations, and a dedicated page introducing the WAPH course with
related lab and project work.</p>

<h2 id="task-1-general-requirements">Task 1: General requirements</h2>
<p>I built a personal portfolio website that highlights my academic
background, technical skills, and career goals in cybersecurity. The
website was created using semantic HTML5 structure and styled with
Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness across devices. I included all
required elements such as my full name, headshot (150x150 pixels), email
address, a brief biography, and a downloadable resume. Furthermore, I
created a separate HTML page (waph.html) that introduces the “Web
Application Programming and Hacking” course. This page outlines the
labs, hackathons, and project work completed as part of the course and
links back to the main profile for easy navigation.</p>

<h3 id="task-2-non-technical-requirements">Task 2: Non-technical
requirements</h3>
<p>I chose Bootstrap 5 as the CSS framework for this project to ensure a
clean, modern design and consistent layout across different screen
sizes. Using Bootstrap’s grid system and built-in components like cards,
buttons, and typography, I developed a user-friendly interface suitable
for employers and recruiters. To make the website feel more
professional, I kept the color scheme dark with contrasting text. I also
integrated a visitor tracking feature using FlagCounter, which visually
displays country-based page view stats at the bottom of the site,
serving as a basic analytics tool.</p>

<h3 id="javascript-code">JavaScript Code</h3>
<p>I implemented several interactive features to enhance user
experience. The digital clock was created using JavaScript’s Date object
and setInterval() function, which updates every second. This clock is
displayed on the homepage and serves as a dynamic element that indicates
real-time updates. The analog clock, styled with a canvas, was
implemented using the clock.js script provided in the lecture.</p>

<p>To protect personal information, I used jQuery to add a show/hide
functionality for the email address. Clicking the link toggles
visibility of the email using a fade effect. As an additional feature, I
implemented a visit-tracking cookie. On first-time visits, users are
greeted with a welcome message. For returning users, the page displays
the timestamp of their last visit, helping to personalize their
experience while demonstrating my understanding of JavaScript cookies
and DOM manipulation.</p>

<h3 id="public-web-apis-integration">Public Web APIs Integration</h3>
<p>I added two dynamic data sources. First, I used the JokeAPI to fetch
a random programming joke every 60 seconds. The jokes are displayed
inside a paragraph element on the homepage. This was implemented using
the fetch() function along with setInterval() to refresh the content
periodically.</p>

<p>I included the XKCD comic API to display a comic image and its title.
Due to cross-origin restrictions, I used a CORS proxy
(api.allorigins.win) to access the data without error. I created a
visually prominent section on the site to show the latest comic, which
is updated dynamically using JavaScript. I also included an appropriate
disclaimer that makes it clear that the content is generated by
third-party services and I am not responsible for their data.</p>

<h3 id="javascript-cookies">JavaScript Cookies</h3>
<p>To track returning visitors, I implemented a client-side cookie
system using native JavaScript. When a user first visits the website, a
cookie is set with the current date and time. Upon subsequent visits,
the script reads this cookie and displays a welcome back message along
with the stored timestamp of the last visit. This was achieved using
document.cookie along with custom logic to parse and update the stored
value. This feature demonstrates my understanding of persistent
client-side data handling and enhances user personalization.</p>
